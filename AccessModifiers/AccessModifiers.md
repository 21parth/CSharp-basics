# Access Modifiers in c#
## Public 
- We can access public members of the class anywhere in the code.
## Private
- We can access private members of the class only in the class in which they are declared.
## Protected
- we can access protected members only in the class ( in which they are declared ) and the derived class.
## Internal
- We can access internal classes in the same assembly or you can say same class library or in same dll.
## Internal protected
- It is weird. same assembly and derived class. Wait what??
